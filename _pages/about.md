I am trained as a data scientist during my undergrad at UCSD, so I’m part mathematician and part programmer 🧑‍🤝‍🧑. Right now, I consider myself as an applied researcher in the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence, because there are a lot of exciting work in this field. 

Currently, I am a graduate student at the University of Toronto’s Master of Science in Applied Computing program with a concentration in computer science.

Some of my areas of interest are:

Machine reasoning and reinforcement learning 🧠
Application of graph neural network (GNN) 🌳
Generative modeling method ♺
and more…
More specifically, I have done research/projects in:

Model neuron activation dynamics with ML method 🧬
Generate Graph adversarial examples with WGAN 🤺
Image caption generation on user uploaded pictures 📱
If you are interested in my experience and projects, please take a look at my project page and cv, also feel free to reach out to me at **jonathan[dot]hellwig[at]kit[dot]edu**
